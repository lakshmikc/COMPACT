## 🧬 What Does COMPACT Do?

Biological datasets are complex, noisy, and often high-dimensional. COMPACT was designed to cut through that complexity by:

- Identifying **statistically robust expression patterns** across experimental conditions
- Performing **comparative pattern counting** to reveal condition-specific and shared signatures
- Enabling **systems-level interpretation** of transcriptomic data
- Providing **publication-ready visualizations** of genomic patterns

Whether you're working with RNA-seq data from disease vs. control comparisons, time-series experiments, or multi-condition studies, COMPACT gives you a structured, reproducible framework to make sense of the patterns in your data.

## 📦 Installation

COMPACT is an R-based pipeline. To get started, ensure you have R (≥ 4.0) installed.

### Install from GitHub

```r
# Install devtools if you don't have it
install.packages("devtools")

# Install COMPACT
devtools::install_github("lakshmikc/COMPACT")
```

### Dependencies

COMPACT requires the following R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", "reshape2", "pheatmap"))

# Bioconductor dependencies
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install(c("DESeq2", "edgeR", "limma"))
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```r
library(COMPACT)

# Load your expression matrix (genes x samples)
# Rows = genes, Columns = samples
expr_matrix <- read.csv("your_expression_data.csv", row.names = 1)

# Define your sample groups
groups <- c("control", "control", "treated", "treated")

# Run COMPACT analysis
results <- compact_run(
  expr      = expr_matrix,
  groups    = groups,
  threshold = 0.05,     # adjusted p-value cutoff
  pattern   = "all"     # analyze all pattern types
)

# View top patterns
head(results$patterns)

# Generate summary plot
compact_plot(results)
```
